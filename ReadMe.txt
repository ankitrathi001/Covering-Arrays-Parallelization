P1_ANKIT_RATHI_SERIAL.c
=========================
This is the c program source file for serial program. It needs to be compiled on ASURE. For compilation the test shell script is provided as "run.sh"

P1_ANKIT_RATHI_PARALLEL.c
==========================
This is the c program source file for parallel program. It needs to be compiled on ASURE. For compilation the test shell script is provided as "run.sh"

Ankit_Rathi_1207543476_Milestone_Report.pdf
===========================================
Design and analysis of data structures used is explained in this report.

Ankit_Rathi_1207543476_Full_Report.pdf
===========================================
Design and analysis of how to parallelize the program is explained in this report. How different tools of Intel Parallel Studio have been used to achieve parallelism is also explained in this report with screenshots where ever applicable.

folder CSE430_P1/
==================
Contains the sample test files along with the serial and parallel programs.

run.sh
=======
This is the shell script to be executed on the ASURE. It contains commands to compile and execute the serial and parallel programs and puts the serial and parallel time output into a file named "Output_1207543476".

Output Format
=============
When the code is executed using the run.sh, all the testfiles listed in the run.sh file gets executed and output is displayed sequentially on the console.
Don't care Matrix, Whether it is Covering Array or not, Don't Care position is also listed on the console.
The code also generates a Output_1207443476 file to record the output. This is used to record only the execution time of serial and parallel programs for easy plotting of graphs.
